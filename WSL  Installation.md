#WSL2 - Installation


**Windows 11**
1. Launch Windows Terminal/Powershell
2. Type the command 'wsl --install --no-distribution --web-download'. This command will install the WSL2 kernel from the Microsoft server instead of the Windows Store. This enables WSL to be updated via Microsoft Updates which gets the updates quicker than the store app.
3. Reboot the system.
4. After reboot launch terminal/powershell again. Run the command 'wsl --status'. It should display the WSL version which means WSL was installed.
5. Run the command 'wsl --list --online'. This will list all the available Linux distributions available for WSL.
6. You can also install your preferred distro from the Microsoft Store. To install your preferred distro from command line type the command 'wsl --install <distro name> --web-download'. The name is no case sensitive. This will download and install the distro from the web instead of the Microsoft Store.
7. Once installed it will ask you to supply a username and password. Store this safely. It wont always ask you but will be needed when you install a package or perform other activities that require Superuser rights in the linux distro.
    
Optionally if you want WSL1 support on Windows 11 then enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux component by running the below command
    `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`

    
**Windows 10**

NOTE: You need Windows 10 Build 2004 or higher. Build 20H2 recommended.
