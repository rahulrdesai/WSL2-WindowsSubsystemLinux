# WSL2-WindowsSubsystemLinux
Guides and scripts for setting up various apps and distros in Windows Subsystem for Linux

Currently this repo only has wiki articles. I will be updating this with some basic powershell scripts on setting this up easily. The commands in these scripts are also there in the wiki articles.

My work on WSL is on going. Installing apps on WSL poses some challenges when compared to installing the same applicaion in a VM. However WSL has it's perks. The biggest perk is having a linux cmd shell up and running at your fingertips without the need for a lot of setup and using a fraction of the resources compared to hosting a VM.
